This is a very old project of mine that endeavored to create a fun 
multi-cellular automata game. Presently you can build automata with 
WireWorld-equivalent pieces, some similar-but-different-to Brian 
Silverman's WireWorld pieces, and Conway's Game of Life. Each cellular 
automata is restricted to its own "layer," but there are some special 
WireWorld-layer pieces which can interact with Conway's Life layer. I'm 
not sure what I have in mind for this little program. The program runs 
on SDL and OpenGL

TODO

 - Better support for loading from images (right now it's very fickle)
 - Zooming / panning the display
 - Adjusting the simulation speed
 - Adjusting the frame rate
 - Adding multiple graphical back-ends. Presently only OpenGL is 
supported, which was a stupid decision if you ask me. However I will 
keep OpenGL support because I want to add optimized automata simulation 
implementations written in GLSL.
 - Add SDL 1.3 back-end
 - Improve game colors
 - Make colors customizable
